# Kconnectex CLI

A CLI for Kafka Connect, inspired by [kaf](https://github.com/birdayz/kaf) for Kafka.

It is based on [kconnectex](https://github.com/jmks/kconnectex).

## Building

This library can be [baked into an executable](https://github.com/bake-bake-bake/bakeware):

```
$ mix bake
$ ./kconnectex --help
```

## TODO

* port code over from kconnectex
* fix exit statuses?
* run via docker
* Make errors uniform - error type?
* `completion` command to generate script for bash, zsh
* strictly output JSON (possible?)

## Development

TODO
